# Find Peak Element

## Problem Description

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

**Example 1:**

```js
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```js
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
	int findPeakElement(vector<int>& arr) {
		int n = arr.size();
		if(n == 1) return 0;
		if(arr[0] > arr[1]) return 0; //additional check
		if(arr[n-1] > arr[n-2]) return n-1;
		int low = 1, high= n - 2; // yeh imp step hai!
		while(low <= high) {
			int mid = low + (high-low) / 2;
			if(arr[mid] > arr[mid - 1] && arr[mid] > arr[mid+1])
				return mid;
			else if(arr[mid] > arr[mid-1])
				low = mid +1;
			else
				high = mid - 1;
		}
	return -1;
	}
};
```
