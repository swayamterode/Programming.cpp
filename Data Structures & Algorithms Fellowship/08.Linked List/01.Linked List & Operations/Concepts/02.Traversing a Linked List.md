# Traversing a Linked List

In the field of data structures and algorithms, a linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements called nodes. Each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Traversing a linked list means visiting each node in the list to perform specific operations, such as printing the values or searching for a particular element.

# Traversal Algorithm

Traversing a linked list involves starting from the head of the list and visiting each subsequent node until the end of the list is reached. The algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Start at the head of the linked list.
2. Set the current node to the head.
3. While the current node is not null:
   - Perform operations on the current node (e.g., print the value).
   - Move to the next node by updating the current node to its next reference.
4. Repeat steps 3-4 until the current node becomes null, indicating the end of the list.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Node {
public:
    int value;
    Node* next;

    Node(int value) {
        this->value = value;
        this->next = nullptr;
    }
};

class LinkedList {
public:
    Node* head;

    LinkedList() {
        this->head = nullptr;
    }

    void traverse() {
        Node* current = head;
        while (current != nullptr) {
            std::cout << current->value << " ";
            current = current->next;
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    LinkedList linkedList;
    linkedList.head = new Node(10);
    linkedList.head->next = new Node(20);
    linkedList.head->next->next = new Node(30);

    linkedList.traverse();

    return 0;
}

```
