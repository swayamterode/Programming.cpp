# Finding the Length of a Linked List

In the field of data structures and algorithms, a linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements called nodes. Each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. One common operation performed on a linked list is finding the length, which refers to the total number of nodes in the list. In this article, we will explore different approaches to finding the length of a linked list and provide example code in Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript.

# Approach 1: Iterative Counting

The first approach involves traversing the linked list iteratively and counting the number of nodes encountered. Here is the algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable count to 0.
2. Start at the head of the linked list.
3. Set the current node to the head.
4. While the current node is not null:
   Increment count by 1.
   - Move to the next node by updating the current node to its next reference.
5. Return count as the length of the linked list.

# Approach 2: Recursive Counting

The second approach involves using recursion to count the length of the linked list. Here is the algorithm:

1. If the current node is null, return 0.
2. Otherwise, return 1 + the length of the rest of the list (i.e., the length of the list starting from the next node).

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Node {
public:
    int value;
    Node* next;

    Node(int value) {
        this->value = value;
        this->next = nullptr;
    }
};

class LinkedList {
public:
    Node* head;

    LinkedList() {
        this->head = nullptr;
    }

    int iterativeCount() {
        int count = 0;
        Node* current = head;
        while (current != nullptr) {
            count++;
            current = current->next;
        }
        return count;
    }

    int recursiveCount(Node* node) {
        if (node == nullptr)
            return 0;
        return 1 + recursiveCount(node->next);
    }
};

int main() {
    LinkedList linkedList;
    linkedList.head = new Node(10);
    linkedList.head->next = new Node(20);
    linkedList.head->next->next = new Node(30);

    int iterativeLength = linkedList.iterativeCount();
    std::cout << "Iterative Length: " << iterativeLength << std::endl;

    int recursiveLength = linkedList.recursiveCount(linkedList.head);
    std::cout << "Recursive Length: " << recursiveLength << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

```
