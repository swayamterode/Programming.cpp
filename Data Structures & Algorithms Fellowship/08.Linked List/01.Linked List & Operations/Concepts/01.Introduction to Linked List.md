# Introduction to Linked List

In the field of data structures and algorithms, a linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements called nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations.

# Node Structure

A linked list is made up of nodes, and each node contains two main components:

- `Value`: The actual data stored in the node.
- `Next`: A reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

In some variations of linked lists, an additional reference to the previous node may be included, creating a doubly linked list. For simplicity, we will focus on the basic singly linked list structure.

# Singly Linked List

In a singly linked list, each node has a reference to the next node in the sequence, except for the last node, which points to null to indicate the end of the list. The first node in the list is called the head, and it serves as the starting point for accessing and traversing the list.

Here's an example of a singly linked list with three nodes:

```
Node 1        Node 2        Node 3
+-------+    +-------+    +-------+
| Value |    | Value |    | Value |
|   10     |    |   20    |    |   30  |
|  Next ------> Next ------> null |
+-------+    +-------+    +-------+
   Head         Middle        Tail
```

In this example, the value of the first node is 10, the value of the second node is 20, and the value of the third (last) node is 30. The next reference of the first node points to the second node, and the next reference of the second node points to the third node. The next reference of the third node is null, indicating the end of the list.

# Linked List Operations

Linked lists support various operations, including:

`Insertion:` Adding a new node to the list.

`Deletion:` Removing a node from the list.

`Traversal:` Visiting each node in the list to perform specific operations.

`Searching:` Finding a specific value or node in the list.

`Access:` Retrieving the value of a node at a given position.

`Update:` Modifying the value of a node.
